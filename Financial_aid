I belong to a lower middleclass family with 5 siblings and my childhood was spent in poverty.From childhood onwards as i was the eldest of all my siblings i had to handle family responsibilities and household works so was not able to continue further into studies.As to go for higher education requires a lot of money and i being poor couldnt afford such.several times i wanted to skillup myself technically but each time it was the financial factor that came in between me and the education.I am enthusiast and eager to go for technical courses i.e Graphics design but it was the low financial condition of mine that never permitted me to have this courses.I want to do this course to overcome the financial barrier.This courses if i do will open up the gates of success for me thereby overcoming the financial barrier that always pulls me back while i try to skillup myself.As mentioned above my financial condition is so weak that is why i am applying for financial condition.



I came across this course while i was in collage but my financial condition was so weak that i was not able to permit the course.I came to know about financial aid available for this course from one of my friend .pursuing  this course will open up the gates of success for me thereby eliminating the financial barrier that always pulls me when i try to skillup myself with technical skills.As you know the course of graphics design is very important in technical sectors and it will also open up the job opportunities for me and thereby making me liable to skilled up in the field to technology.The graphics design is very important and integral part of modern technological domain and having a masters in it will help in complete development of mine.




As i mentioned above my financial condition is so weak and i am so poor that i can only afford the course if it can be availed for free.
